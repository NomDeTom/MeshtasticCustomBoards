# SerialLogger app with autoreconnect

Actual code and executables here
https://github.com/mrekin/meshlog

## Why
Just because :) 
Want to have customizible serial logger. Putty fine, but useless when you want to connect/disconnect your device many times.

## Functionality
* UI :)
* COM port list
* Autoreconnect to latest port
* Custom labels (capturing data based on rules, some examples in config)

## Need to know
* "Settings" currently don't work
* Just exe right now, planned to move to separate repo with source code
* Code not perfect :)
* Really, code not perfect!


## Cons
* Too fat: builded with python and Textual, output .exe is too big.
